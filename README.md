# Covid19-Research_Project
Project to find the necessary ligands and molecules to kill the active nature of Corona Virus plus test the new drugs coming to the markets .


### Note: 
To use the code, download the "experiments" folder from google drive ( ~74 mbs ) (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mx3EhJb90joKFBsE5gBDocMfhmQ6ozGk?usp=sharing)
and paste the experiments folder in the main directory. 

### The Problem Statement: 
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LJgkovowgA ( Taken from Siraj Rawals challenge on How to Treat Corona Virus using State of the Art Deep Learning Techniques "without" knowing too much biology )

### The Solution 
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVoZMRmtBkY ( 6:33 -> end of the video though I suggest watching the entire video ). The solution is given by Matt O Connor is one of the best solutions I found due to it's little dependence on understanding biology and more focus on Chemistry ( ~level is class 11 ). You may need to understand a bit about Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). It's kind of easy , just your another Mid-Sem like topic. Watch a youtube video or 2.

* Read this paper then : https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/minf.201700111 -- Don't get intimidated by the paper, On paper it is really simple. If you don't understand it, call me, I'll explain it. 

* Then read the readme of https://github.com/topazape/LSTM_Chem --> This is the implementation of the paper you read/ will read above. Everything is coded, you dont need to code anything, just need to run the code

* After this point , you pretty much have done 80% of the paper

* Now you read the readme of https://github.com/mattroconnor/deep_learning_coronavirus_cure --> This is the link of the code repo of the "Matt O Connor's" implementation of the paper. ( 95% of the code is the same as you read earlier )

* Then you need to see what ligands are... What Docking is.... How to do ligand docking with PyRx ( 1-2 hours of understanding , that's it )

* Now we need to do some changes to make our work look original ( The Hard Part -> You have ~ 1 year for this )


### Some tips 
* The main part is to watch the videos and understanding the paper I provided in "The Solution" Above. If you understand the paper and are able to relate to the parts of code related to the paper; it is extremely easy. You dont have to code even a single line of code.

* Mid way you may think it's hard, it's not.

* Major is what you need to worry about, minor is a piece of cake.

* Getting results published in a journal of Deep Learning is way easier with a complicated looking project.
