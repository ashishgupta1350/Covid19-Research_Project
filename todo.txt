Done Part:
Add the source code from Base De Novo Design to the repo
Get some smiles on potential treatement cures of corona virus

Parts to Do:
[done] save these smiles into a SMI file and clean the smiles using inbuilt cleaner
[done] check if these smiles are valid 
[done] fine tune the model, generate 1000+ smiles
[done] clean these smiles using inbuilt cleaner 
[done] cluster the cleaned smiles into 30 sets, find 1 centric smile from each cluster
[doing] Randomly take 1 compound out of each cluster and test the binding affinity
run a binding affinity in pyrx for each of these 30 smiles and find the binding affinity 
take the max |affinity| smiles ( 3 - 10 ( idk try) ) and find the tanimoto score similarity for the max|affinity| smile generated from the last step
print out the actual molecules with the max |affinity|

We have to do several things:
1) Download the dataset and reform the code to get csv files
2) Clean the csv / sql data to just get those SMILES string talked in paper
3) Train the model using the code provided
4) Generate 1000 SMILES string
5) Run the affinity check on 30 samples
6) Find the structures with max Timosimilarity to the one that has highest |affinity| 
7) Rank them in order and generate prediction ( The molecules should have atleast <-11 affinity)
