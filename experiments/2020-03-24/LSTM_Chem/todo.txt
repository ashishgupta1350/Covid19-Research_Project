We have to do several things:
1) Download the dataset and reform the code to get csv files
2) Clean the csv / sql data to just get those SMILES string talked in paper
3) Train the model using the code provided
4) Generate 1000 SMILES string
5) Run the affinity check on 30 samples
6) Find the structures with max Timosimilarity to the one that has highest |affinity| 
7) Rank them in order and generate prediction ( The molecules should have atleast <-11 affinity)
